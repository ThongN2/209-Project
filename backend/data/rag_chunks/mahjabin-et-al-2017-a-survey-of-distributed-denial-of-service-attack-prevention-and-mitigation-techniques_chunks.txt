capacity traffic handling support to the edge networks.This design ensures maximum utilization of the linkswith minimum costs. However, this also introduces thepossibility to overwhelm an edge network if multiplesources talk to a single destination.

Thus, the core routers have
some limitations which help the DDoS attacks. Thecore routers cannot provide authentication services tothe delivered IP packets. This limitation introduces adeep trouble known as IP spoofing which is one of thekey powers of the DDoS attacks.
4In IP spoofing, theattackers provide false information such as fake source
IP addresses in the IP packets.8Furthermore, the rou-
ters also cannot provide packet tracing mechanismsbecause of the enormous traffic handled by them.These limitations provide the attackers the opportunityto remain hidden while performing DDoS attacks. Thedesign of the Internet also ensures high-capacity traffic

nature of the Internet management, all the networksare managed locally rather than with a central manage-ment authority or hierarchy.

Also, the resource of a victim is always limited as com-pared to the resource of attackers as they can use a dis-tributed attack scenario.

/C15Intellectual challenge. The attackers of this group
are mainly motivated to conduct DDoS attacks
to show off their capabilities and power. Theavailability of the easy-to-use attack tools and
botnets motivates these attackers to conduct
experiments of DDoS attacks.
/C15Cyberwarfare. This is another important attack
motivation which incurs danger and significant
economic impacts on its targets. Generally, somewell-trained people of a military or terroristorganization conduct an attack of this type.
Here, the attackers belong to some countries and
perform their attacks on some other country’sorganizations. A significant amount of resource
and time are used to do such attacks and this
may paralyze a country’s cyberworld and criticalinfrastructure through service disruptions.
Attack strategies
The basic structure of a DDoS attack is presented inFigure 3.
19It comprises three different phases and four
different components.20The components are known as
an attacker, multiple control masters or handlers, mul-tiple slaves, agents, or zombies, and a victim or target
machine.
In the first phase, the attacker spends a lot of its
time to create a significant amount of compromised
machines which are called the masters or handlers as
they appoint and control other machines in the attackarmy.

There are three different
phases of DDoS attacks which can be named as Phase
I—recruiting attack armies, Phase II—propagation,and Phase III—attack. The details of these phases arelisted in the following.
Phase I: recruiting attack armies. The first phase of the
DDoS attacks is to generate the attack army or botnet
as mentioned before. For this purpose, the attacker usesworms (self-propagating programs)
21that infect the
devices of the users by taking the advantages of theirsecurity flaws.
22Many different techniques are used to
generate this army as mentioned in different researchpapers.

/C15Random scanning. In the random scanning strat-
egy, already infected machines probe with ran-
dom IP addresses from the IP address space to
infect new machines.

27This scanning produces
a huge traffic since it is very likely for themachines to be situated in different networks.Also, the lack of synchronization among differ-ent compromised machines creates high numberof duplicate probes from the infected machines.As the number of infected machines increases, itincreases the possibility to infect more machines.However, the extreme traffic produced by themalso creates the possibility to detect the attack.Mahjabin et al.

propagation mechanism, the attack code propa-gates from a central server to the compromised

this is a 1i0n worm which propagates in thismanner.

code from some central points, it introduces a
huge amount of traffic in the network which may
eventually lead to the attack discovery.

of an attack army is to propagate the attack code to
the compromised devices. This attack code includes

cessful one but introduced the attack of this type.
Recently, exactly after 14 years, in 21 October 2016, the
largest DDoS attack has targeted a major infrastructureknown as the Dyn DNS.
1This system provides DNS
address resolution service to more than 3,500 enterpri-sers which also include some renowned organization
like Netflix, Twitter, Linkedin, and so on.
56It provides
high-performance service with managed DNS infra-structure which includes numerous data centers locatedin multiple continents.

Since the DNS maintains ahierarchical structure, an attack of this type which tar-gets only the root name servers could not put very seri-ous impacts on the Internet service of the whole world.Commonly, attackers use DNS flooding techniques to
launch the attack. In the DNS flooding attack, compro-
mised attack army or botnet sends normal UDPrequests to the DNS server. However, the amount ofsuch requests is so enormous that it floods the systemand eventually all of the resources are consumed. Thus,
the system denies all legitimate requests for a significant
amount of time. On 21 October 2002, an infrastructureattack was launched which targeted all 13 root nameservers.

increase is required on all critical connections. A goodnumber of replicated servers and data centers are also
required to ensure elimination of single point failure. It
also helps to reduce the surface of the attack and intro-duces difficulty to exhaust existing resources and link
saturation.
Prevention based on awareness
Recent DDoS attacks mostly the IoT botnet–based
DDoS attacks require awareness of the IoT users. Thisis because the IoT devices are very poor in terms of
security. Also, some DDoS attacks can be prevented if
the general user takes preventive measures in their ownsystem. It not only ensures their security from being
attacked but also from being a zombie of the attack
army.

The identification of
the attack source as well as the network path of theattack traffic is known as IP traceback. In this section,we will introduce some popular methods of attack
source identification.

or the supervisory control and data acquisition centerscan be the target of DoS attacks.

Furthermore, somemitigation techniques are also found, including
resource scaling,

DDoS attacks on smart grids
Smart Grid is the evolution of the traditional powergrid to a smart infrastructure which incorporates theInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT)to the traditional electric power supply systems.
169–171
It is a distributed power source with automated mainte-nance and operating capabilities which improve relia-bility and quality of the power as well as enhance the
capacity and efficiency of the traditional power sys-
tems.
172It requires a robust communication network
for its reliable access, process, and delivery of the infor-mation. This delivery becomes damaged or disruptedwhen a DoS attack gets success in the smart grid, andas indicated in the work by Liu et al.,
173there are sig-
nificant amount of attacks in smart grids. Moreover, insmart grid, it is very important to ensure the timing
constraints of the transferred messages because thistiming constraint is the benchmark to the reliable mon-
itoring and control of the systems. This constraint alsoimposes a threat to the smart grid since the mainimpact of the DoS attack is to make the system una-
vailable to reach and this introduces delay to the trans-
fer of the messages. In Smart Grid, DoS attacks cantarget different communication layers: network, trans-port, medium access control (MAC), and physicallayers through flooding or jamming in the substa-tions.
171Also, the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)
or the supervisory control and data acquisition centerscan be the target of DoS attacks. Thus, a successful
DoS attack can cause severe service degradation as the
control and monitoring operations depend on timelymessage transfer.

few months of the 2016, the cyberworld has faced someof the largest (in size) DDoS attacks of its history onhttps://KrebsOnSecurity.com (620 Gbps),
188OVH
attack (990 Gbps),189and Dyn DNS (1.2 Tbps).190All
of these attacks have involved millions of IPs from allof these smart devices. As we have already mentionedin section ‘‘Prevention based on awareness,’’ it is veryimportant to ensure device security through the actionsfrom the device manufacturers and end users. On theother hand, as the IoT devices are working in different
sophisticated areas such as health care, rescue service,
connected vehicles, if these devices face a DoS attack, acatastrophic event may occur if the devices deny to
communicate and provide services in critical situations.
So far authentication is the solution to the DoS attacks
in such devices. Thus, it is very important to put moreattentions to this massively growing field of theInternet.

refers to a new generation of systems with integrated
computational and physical capabilities. Thus, it is a
future system that will work as a bridge between thecyber and the physical worlds of computing.

different methods collaborate with each other as differ-ent methods work on to solve the problem from differ-
ent directions. The real-life attack scenario is very
different from the testing environment which worksbased on some fixed dataset and fixed attack signa-

DDoS attacks involve diverse attackscenario and signatures. Therefore, the researchers are
trying to provide the best possible defense considering
different aspects of the attacks. It is very important totest the real-life performance of those researches. Also,
it is essential to test the performance in real time when
different methods collaborate with each other as differ-ent methods work on to solve the problem from differ-

different from the testing environment which worksbased on some fixed dataset and fixed attack signa-
tures. Therefore, it is important to ensure scalability of
the defense mechanisms in real-time attack scenarios.
Fourth, ensuring defense against the zero-day attack
is always an open research problem.
